### Criticisms of SQL
___
Orthogonality and completeness (fixed in 1982)
Nulls (a must due to the relational model)
Duplicates (easy to allow duplicates than search a large database to see if the two is duplicated)
Impedance mismatch (data types of the host language are not the same as those of SQL)
