## Software Development

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Planning -> Design -> Coding -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance -> ...

### Design process

Design vs Fabrication: while good design can be marred by poor fabrication, usually no good fabrication can disguise poor design.

### Models of the Design Process

- Create a solution.
- Build a model of the solution.
- Test the model against the original requirements.
- Elaborate the model to produce a specification for the solution.

## Design

- Design methods and patterns: help determine which choice is the best for a given situation.
- Representations: help with the process of building models of the intended system and with evaluating its behaviour.
- Abstraction: is concerned with the removal of detail from a description of a problem, while still retaining the essential properties of its structure; it is essential to build manageable models of large and complex systems.

### Viewpoints

The designer will usually make use of a number of different forms of design representation.
Each representation provides a different viewpoint on the form of a design.

'Wicked' problems: a problem whose form is such that a solution for one of its aspects simply changes the problem
