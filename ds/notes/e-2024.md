a) Some indicators include scalability metrics, maintainability index, code qualiy as well as performance and easibility metrics.

b) Separation of concerns allows to isolate different aspects of a system, making it easier to manage complexity, enhance maintainability, and facilitate collaboration among development teams. By separating concerns, changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on other parts, leading to a more robust and adaptable architecture.

a) Performance is the ability of a system to respond quickly to user inputs or process data efficiently. It is crucial for user satisfaction and overall system effectiveness, especially in applications where speed and responsiveness are key.

b) Performance and code quality are interrelated as they counter balance each other. High performance code may sacrifice readability and maintainability, while high code quality may introduce overhead that impacts performance. Striking a balance between the two is essential for creating efficient and maintainable software systems.

Tempo medio de resposta = Tempo de processamento / Tempo de resposta

Pambos = a1a2
Ps1 = a1(1-a2)
Ps2 = (1-a1)a2
Pnenhum = 0

Tambos = 1/s1 (s1 > s2)
Ts1 = 1/s1
Ts2 = 1/s2

Psucesso = Ps1 + Ps2 - Pambos = a1+a2-a1a2
Tmedio = (Pambos x Tambos + Ps1 x Ts1 + Ps2 x Ts2) / Psucesso
= (a1a2 x 1/s1 + a1(1-a2) x 1/s1 + (1-a1)a2 x 1/s2) / a1+a2-a1a2

a) A client-server architecture would benefit this type of system the most, as the client allows for a user-friendly interface for costumers to browse and purchase products, while the server handles product suggestions, inventory management, and payment processing. This separation of concerns allows for scalability, as the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, and it also facilitates maintenance and updates to either the client or server independently. Scaling servers can be done based on demand, ensuring that the system remains responsive during peak shopping times, while clients can be lightweight applications or web interfaces that run on various devices, as well as the increase of database capacity to handle more products and user data. A pub-sub implementation can also be used to handle real-time updates if needed. However, potential challenges include complexity in managing server load and balancing performance across different client devices, as well as coding security measures to protect sensitive user information during transactions.

b) (Image of a client-server architecture with multiple clients connected to a central server, where the server is shown to be scalable and containing multiple microservices for different functionalities like product management, user authentication, and payment processing. It also shows a database, scalable as well, connected to N servers for load balancing and redundancy. Usage of a pub-sub system for real-time updates on inventory and order status is also depicted.)

The use of multiple views is necessary because different stakeholders have different concerns and requirements. For example, developers may focus on the implementation view, while business stakeholders may be more interested in the process view. By providing multiple views, the architecture can effectively communicate its structure and behavior to all stakeholders, ensuring that their concerns are addressed and facilitating better decision-making throughout the development process.

#### 3

A microservice focused client-server architecture has the big advantage of scalability and modularity, allowing independent deployment and scaling of services based on demand. If one microservice experiences high load, it can be scaled independently without affecting the entire system. This architecture also enhances fault isolation, as failures in one service do not necessarily impact others.

a)
A quality scenario has six parts: source (who/what triggers), stimulus (the event), environment (system state), artifact (affected component), response (what happens), response measure (quantifiable metric). They provide several advantages like requirements testable, clear communication, design guidance, validation criteria, prioritization, and evaluation basis with non-technical stakeholders.

Source of Stimulus: User requests for product recommendations.
Stimulus: A user browses products on the e-commerce platform.
Environment: Normal operation with average load (10000 users).
Artifact: Recommendation engine module.
Response: The recommendation engine processes the user's browsing history and preferences to generate personalized product recommendations.
Measured Response: Time taken to generate and display recommendations, accuracy of recommendations based on user feedback, down from 0.5s to 0.1s for example.

With the system being real-time, the recommendation engine should be able to process user data and generate recommendations quickly, ideally within a few seconds, to ensure a seamless user experience.

b)
Modifiability Scenario:
Source of Stimulus: Change in recommendation algorithm.
Stimulus: A new machine learning algorithm is introduced to improve recommendation accuracy.
Environment: Normal operation.
Artifact: Recommendation engine module.
Response: The recommendation engine is updated to incorporate the new algorithm without affecting other system components.
Measured Response: Time taken to implement the change in 2 working days with 0 impact on system performance and no impact to other modules. Expected load of 15000 users and 500 requests per second.

It allows for the recommendation engine to evolve and improve over time without requiring significant changes to the overall system architecture.

Response Time Scenario:
Source of Stimulus: User requests for recommendations.
Stimulus: A user requests product recommendations during peak shopping hours.
Environment: High load with many concurrent users.
Artifact: Recommendation engine module.
Response: The recommendation engine processes the request and generates recommendations within an acceptable time frame.
Measured Response: Time taken to generate recommendations under high load conditions under 200ms, with a load of 20000 users and 1000 requests per second.

It ensures that the system can handle increased demand without degrading user experience and reduce, with the same amount of users, a lower response time, from a few seconds to only some miliseconds (1-3s to 0.5s for example).

c) Some prioritization strategies could be implemented, such as focusing on user-facing vs background processing to have a better user experience, or prioritizing critical functionalities like payment processing over less critical ones like product recommendations during high load periods. Additionally, premium vs regular users could be prioritized differently based on their subscription level. However, these strategies are a temporary fix, and the underlying architecture should be designed to handle scalability effectively.
