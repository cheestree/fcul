Some of these include solid and up-to-date reference material for developed software (5th paragraph), consistent code architecture and tools to analyse said code (6th paragraph), a balance of continuous testing and deployment to ensure that a product doesn't stay in "perpetual beta" but is still usable and idea assurance (7th paragraph), built to last and as most failure-proof as one can make it (8th paragraph), as well as make engineering more accessible and "less dependent on arcane knowledge" (9th paragraph).
