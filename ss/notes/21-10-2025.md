### Upcasting and Downcasting

Why is downcasting bad? The field of which the class is being downcast
is on top of a vftptr of another object, which can be overwritten.
The corresponding method of said other object can be accessed.

### Integer overflows

#### Overflow

Result of expression exceeds max value of the type. Most common.  
Usually fixed with the mod operator.

#### Underflow

Result of expression is smaller than the minimum value of the type. Rarer due to being only capable with subtractions.

#### Signedness

Signed integer is interpreted as unsigned or vice-versa.

#### Truncation

Assigning a longer width integer to a smaller one.  
Mallloc allocs too little space -> the code that uses the space corrupts the memory.
